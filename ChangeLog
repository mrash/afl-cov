afl-cov-0.6.2 (12/26/2018):
    - (Tim Strazzere) Add support for llvm-cov compiled binaries. Add a check
      when ensuring the binary was instrumented with gcov to catch an llvm-cov
      binary.
    - Bug fix for number of args to logr(), found by github user @NimdaKey.
      Fixes #38.
    - Allow multi-spaces in --coverage-cmd, found by github user
      @YourButterfly. Fixes #37.
    - Add ToC to README.md.

afl-cov-0.6.1 (11/27/2017):
    - (James Steele) Add the '--follow' command line argument which provides an
      option identical to that available on lcov that instructs the search for
      .da files to follow symlinks (which are not traversed by default).
    - Add the '--disable-gcov-check' argument so that the check for whether
      the target binary has been compiled with code coverage support can be
      disabled.
    - (Denis Kasak) Fix incorrect variable name in search_cov.
    - Bug fix noted by @umlaeute be more permissive with instrumented binaries
      check.

afl-cov-0.6 (06/05/2016):
    - (Markus Teufelberger) Add --cover-corpus argument so that code coverage
      is measured only after all new AFL test cases are executed. The main
      advantage is that code coverage results are produced more quickly in
      this mode since AFL can generate test cases - at least initially - much
      faster than code coverage can be calculated for each test case. The
      trade off in this mode is that code coverage stats are not tracked per
      AFL test case, but rather across all new test cases essentially as a
      unified set. In --live mode, --cover-corpus causes coverage to be
      calculated once per sleep cycle after all test cases have been executed.
      In --coverage-at-exit mode, only a single coverage calculation will be
      performed just before afl-cov exits.
    - In either --cover-corpus or --coverage-at-exit modes, the
      cov/id-delta-cov file will contain AFL test case ID ranges for where
      coverage is hit. This is necessary because these modes cause afl-cov to
      execute a series of AFL test cases (instead of each individual test
      case one at a time) before coverage is calculated.
    - Add a prerequisite test to make sure the targeted binary is compiled
      with code coverage support ('-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage'). This test
      can be run by itself with --gcov-check.
    - Use the tempfile module for temporary files (suggested by Markus
      Teufelberger in issue #19).

afl-cov-0.5 (01/11/2016):
    - For --live mode operations, add the same core pattern detection logic to
      afl-cov that is implemented by afl-fuzz. This helps to ensure that the
      environment in which afl-cov is running is consistent with what afl-fuzz
      expects to see.
    - Make sure --afl-fuzzing-dir exists in --func-search and --line-search
      modes.

afl-cov-0.4 (01/09/2016):
    - Add support for parallelized execution runs of AFL. This is done by
      tracking all fuzzing directory instances created with afl-fuzz '-M' or
      '-S'. These directories are created in the main sync directory
      ('afl-fuzz -o sync_dir'). The coverage results are calculated globally
      across all fuzzing instances.
    - Default to not include branch coverage data within code coverage results
      This is because AFL commonly build up many hundreds of test cases, and
      generating branch coverage across all of these cases may slow afl-cov
      down significantly. However, if branch coverage is desired or required,
      just add the new --enable-branch-coverage argument.
    - Added a test suite in the test/ directory that leverages the python
      unittest module. Proper operation of the test suite requires afl-fuzz
      to be installed, and tests are performed against a particular commit
      (e3ae6747) from the fwknop project for which AFL test cases were
      pre-built.
    - Bug fix reported by @kcwu about some files not showing up in zero
      coverage lcov web reports.

afl-cov-0.3 (06/29/2015):
    - Add --background mode to facilitate clean integration with afl-fuzz
      wrapper scripts. In this mode, afl-cov will wait for afl-fuzz to start,
      produce coverage results while afl-fuzz is running, and then exit
      automatically when finished. Here is an example of a wrapper script from
      the fwknop project that combines afl-cov in --background mode with
      afl-fuzz:

        https://github.com/mrash/fwknop/blob/master/test/afl/fuzzing-wrappers/client-rc.sh

    - Add fuzzing-dir/cov/afl-cov.log file to track verbose run time
      information.
    - Add fuzzing-dir/cov/afl-cov-status file to track the current PID, argv,
      and afl-cov version.

afl-cov-0.2 (05/28/2015):
    - Add the fuzzing-dir/cov/id-delta-cov file which lists all functions and
      (and optionally lines) that are executed by the first "id:000000*" test
      case, and then lists all new functions/lines executed in subsequent test
      cases. In --func-search or --line-search modes, the id-delta-cov file is
      parsed directly instead of parsing cov/diff/ file output. Here is an
      example of what the contents of this file looks like:

      # id:NNNNNN*_file, cycle, src_file, coverage_type, fcn/line
      id:000000,orig:access.conf, 0, proj/log_msg.c, function, free_logging()
      id:000000,orig:access.conf, 0, proj/log_msg.c, function, init_logging()
      id:000000,orig:access.conf, 0, proj/log_msg.c, function, log_msg()

    - Replace the fuzzing-dir/cov/zero-cov/ directory with a single file
      at the same path fuzzing-dir/cov/zero-cov that lists all
      functions/lines that are never executed by any AFL test case.
    - Add the fuzzing-dir/cov/pos-cov file that lists all functions/lines
      that are executed at least once by an AFL test case.
    - Use the 'fuzzer_stats' file for acquiring the afl-fuzz PID in --live
      mode. This closes issue #4 on github.
    - Default to not preserving all lcov files - just keep the final one that
      contains all cumulative coverage results. This behavior can be changed
      with the --preserve-all-lcov-files argument.
    - Track and display the AFL cycle number for each queue/id:NNNNNN* file.

afl-cov-0.1 (05/09/2015):
    - Initial release
